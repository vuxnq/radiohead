        <h3>The early years (1992 - 1995)</h3>
        <p>Radiohead released their first single, "Creep" in 1992. The song was initially unsuccessful, but it became a
          worldwide hit several months after the release of their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Radiohead's
          popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). The band's
          textured guitar parts and Yorke's falsetto singing were warmly received by critics and fans.</p>

        <h3>International success (1996 - 2000)</h3>
        <p>Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to greater international fame. Featuring an
          expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, OK Computer has often been acclaimed as a landmark record of
          the 1990s.</p>

        <h3>A change in style and leaving EMI (2000 - 2003)</h3>
        <p>Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked a change in the band's musical style. Radiohead incorporated
          experimental electronic music, Krautrock, post-punk and jazz influences into their songs, dividing fans and
          critics, but they remained popular. Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of guitar-driven rock, electronics and
          lyrics inspired by headlines, was the band's final album for their major record label, EMI.</p>

        <h3>Independent releases and touring (2005 - 2013)</h3>
        <p>In 2007, Radiohead independently released their seventh album, In Rainbows, originally as a digital download
          for which each customer could set their own price, later in stores, to critical and chart success.</p>
        <p>In 2011, Radiohead released their eighth album, The King of Limbs - again independently - which was described
          as an exploration of rhythm and quieter textures.</p>
        <p>In February 2012, Radiohead began The King of Limbs world tour - with concerts in the US, Canada, Mexico,
          Europe, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. In early 2013, following the tour, Thom Yorke
          released a studio album entitled Amok with his band Atoms for Peace.</p>

          Pool" on various streaming services. The band announced the release of their latest 11-track album on Twitter.
