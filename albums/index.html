          <h3>1993</h3>
          <p>Pablo Honey is the debut studio album by English rock band Radiohead. It was released on 22 February 1993
            in the United Kingdom by Parlophone and in the United States by Capitol Records. It was produced by Sean
            Slade and Paul Kolderie and was recorded at Chipping Norton Recording Studios and Courtyard Studio in
            Oxfordshire, England, from September to November 1992. The album's title comes from a Jerky Boys prank call
            skit in which the prank caller says to his target, "Pablo, honey? Please come to Florida!".</p>

          <h3>1995</h3>
          <p>The Bends is the second studio album by English rock band Radiohead. It was released on 13 March 1995 in
            the
            United Kingdom by Parlophone and in the United States by Capitol Records. Produced by John Leckie and
            engineered by Nigel Godrich, who would go on to co-produce all future albums by the band, The Bends marked
            the
            beginning of a shift in aesthetics and themes, with greater use of keyboards and more abrasive and subtle
            guitar tracks. With this album, the introspective grunge-influenced style of the band's 1993 debut Pablo
            Honey
            evolved into more multi-layered rock with cryptic lyrics and larger ideas, as they reacted against the
            rigours
            of their near-constant world tours.</p>

          <h3>2000</h3>
          <p>Kid A is the fourth studio album by English rock band Radiohead. It was first released on 2 October 2000 in
            the United Kingdom by Parlophone and a day later in the United States by Capitol Records. After suffering a
            near-mental breakdown while touring in support of their previous album OK Computer, the band's lead singer
            and
            songwriter Thom Yorke envisioned a slight change in musical direction for their next album. As a result,
            Radiohead incorporated synthesisers, drum machines, and the ondes Martenot into their instrument lineup, as
            well as influences from genres such as krautrock and electronica.</p>

            theUnited Kingdom by Parlophone and a day later in the United States by Capitol Records. Much of its
            material
            was recorded during the same sessions for the band's previous album Kid A (2000), incorporating similar
            influences of krautrock and electronica. Its lyrics and artwork explore themes of memory, with influences
            from
            ancient Greek and Egyptian mythology.</p>

            Capitol Records. Following the electronic and krautrock-influenced sound of their previous two albums Kid A
            (2000) and Amnesiac (2001), Hail To the Thief features more traditional rock instrumentation while retaining
            electronic elements such as drum machines, synthesisers, and digital manipulation.</p>

        <article>
          <h3>2011</h3>
          <p>The King Of Limbs is the eighth studio album by English rock band Radiohead. It was first released through
            the band's website on 18 February 2011 and physically on 28 March 2011 in the United Kingdom by Ticker Tape
            and XL Recordings and in the United States by TBD Records. Following the protracted recording and more
            conventional instrumentation of their previous album In Rainbows (2007), Radiohead developed much of The
            King
            Of Limbs by sampling and looping recordings. The album was produced by longtime collaborator Nigel Godrich,
            with lead singer and songwriter Thom Yorke describing it as "an expression of wildness and mutation". Its
            title is borrowed from the King of Limbs, an ancient oak tree in Wiltshire's Savernake Forest near Tottenham
            House, where the band recorded much of In Rainbows. Radiohead released no singles from the album, but
            released
            a music video for the song Lotus Flower that spawned a viral internet meme.</p>
